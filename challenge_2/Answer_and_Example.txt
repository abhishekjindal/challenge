Q - What is the big O notation for your program?

A - The big O notation for the program is O(n) as there is a loop through all the elements atleast once.
n is the length of the array of items.

I was able to solve the bonus problem as well and the big O notation for that program is o(n^2) where n is the length of the array of items.


EXAMPLE:

I have included the prices.txt file from the question as an example.

Dependencies - Python 3

1) To run the program to get two items on command line - 
	python find_pair.py prices.txt 2500

2) To run the program to get three items on command line - 
	python find_three.py prices.txt 2500
